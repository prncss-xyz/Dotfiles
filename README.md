# My personnal dotfiles

I've learned a lot about software architechture and system administration here.

Workflow is based on **stow**, with extra scripts to manage system-wide theming. My configuration also features **xplr** file manager and **neovim** text editor. I also use **syncthing** to sync data between machines and favor applications that are compatible with this replication model. 

Lots of reactoring still needs to be done. It is obviously not ready for public scrutiny, however I still need to make it public for my workflow to work (easing new machine installagtion). :-P Also commits are aweful as I ofen need to commit on the go to synchronise between machines. That need will eventually go away with next major refactoring.
